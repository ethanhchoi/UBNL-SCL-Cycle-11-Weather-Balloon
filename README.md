# UBNL-SCL-Cycle-11-Weather-Balloon-PiCamera-Code

### Desccription:
This is the code and results of a that was created during my time at SCL. Unfortunately I've transferred from the University at Buffalo to the Univerrsity at Maryland so I am unable to continue working with this lab. 

### Documentation Utilized: 
Utilized PiCamera2 Documentation: https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/camera/picamera2-manual.pdf

### Project Results and Thoughts: 
- I won't be in Buffalo to finish this project for the actual Balloon Launch with my SCL team(But do hit me up if you want me to participate in this project despite not being there anymore)
- We could try to optimize taking more distant pictures as in increasing picture taking time
